# Basics

This Tool is a Discord invite generation tool capable of generating 100 invites per second. To ensure smooth operation, it's recommended to use a VPN to bypass rate limiting. Although I'm working on integrating a built-in proxy, this feature won't be available until the near future.

# Setup Instructions

1. Install Requirements: There's no requirements file as the only dependency is the requests library.
2. Run deepscan.py: Execute this script to initiate the invite generation process.
3. Locate Generated Invites: All generated JavaScript invites will be saved in a text document located in the project's root directory.
4. Proceed to the Next Section: Follow the steps outlined in the next section for using these generated invites.

# How to Use the Generated Invites

The generated invites won't be in URL format. Instead, they will be provided to you as a function for the website "discord.me". To obtain the Discord invite from one of these generated invites:

1. Navigate to discord.me.
2. Open the JavaScript console in your browser.
3. Run the provided function.
4. Complete the captcha when prompted.
